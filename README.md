## Rules of the game:

1. Each player takes turns to pick 2 cards to flip over from the layout in front of them
2. If the cards match, the player wins 2 points (one for each card) and the cards are removed from play.
3. If the cards do not match, they must be flipped back over and stay in the same position that they started in.
4. The game ends when all the cards have been matched.
5. The player with the most matches wins! üèÜ
